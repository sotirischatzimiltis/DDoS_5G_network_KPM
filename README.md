## Title: An Efficient ML-based Detection Framework for DDoS Attacks in 5G Near Real-Time RIC
### Abstract:
As 5G networks evolve, detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks remains crucial. This paper presents a supervised learning ML-based 5G Core DDoS detection framework, that can be implemented as an xApp within the Near-RT RIC. Utilising statistical features from UE and CELL-specific key performance metrics, our framework achieves high detection rates and low false positives. Testing confirms its effectiveness, with F1-scores of up to 98\%, and detection rates of over 91\%. These results demonstrate the potential use of ML techniques in Open RAN environments to defend 5G networks.
